The kind of project dreams are made of

## Introduction
GitConnect is a platform for developers to create, host and share their portfolios, while also discovering projects from other devs in the community.

Think Dribbble or Behance for engineers.

It comes with simple onboarding - using your Github username & API integration to add repos directly in the UI while the server handles fetching them from GitHubs API.

When a repo is added from Github it becomes a 'GitConnect Project' - allowing developers to add GitConnect specific information about the process, challenges, outcomes etc of the project. They can also add a live version of the project direct on the site which imports it as an iFrame.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from our time in General Assemblies Software Engineering intensive, where we spoke about portfolios regularly.

However the findability of other engineer portfolios on the internet leaves a lot to be desired.

While designer projects are hosted on several popular sites (Behance, Dribbble, Awwwards etc) - developers portfolios might appear on a blog or two. But, they mostly remain hidden in corners of peoples personal sites - only shared when they might want to apply for a new job.
